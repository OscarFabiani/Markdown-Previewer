const editor = document.getElementById('editor');
const preview = document.getElementById('preview');

editor.addEventListener('input', updateText);

function updateText() {
  let newText = editor.value;
  preview.innerHTML = marked(newText, breaks = true);
}

window.addEventListener('load', updateText);

let defaultText = `# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

![React Logo w/ Text](https://goo.gl/Umyytc)`

editor.value = defaultText;

//CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY AND REPLICATE COLOR SCHEME, DROP SHADOW, SCROLLABILITY, EXPAND/CONTRACT BUTTON, MINIMUM HEIGHT, HORIZONTAL RESPONSIVITY, STYLING,
//AND POSSIBLY SOLVE LINEBREAK ISSUE..
